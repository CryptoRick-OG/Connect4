# My First Project

I'm a student a Computer Science student at Codecademy. This is my first project in Python.

## Connect4
**Connect 4** is a great 1st project choice because it is a simple game to code on my own at my current coding level. This project also features the opportunity to practice my AI skills by building a bot that plays the game *(coming soon!)*

### What is Connect 4?
**Connect4** is also known as **Four Up**, **Plot Four**, **Find Four**, **Captain’s Mistress**, **Four in a Row**, **Drop Four**, and **Gravitrips** in the Soviet Union.

It is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.

The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.

The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one’s own discs. Connect Four is a solved game.

The first player can always win by playing the right moves. Sounds fun right? Give it a go with your closest friend! :bowtie:
